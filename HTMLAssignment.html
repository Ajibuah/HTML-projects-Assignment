   <h1><center> My first coding experience</center> </h1>
<p><strong>Coding and programming</strong> in general as always intrigued me,
 and i recently embark on an exciting journey into the world of tech specially <ins>python and web development.</ins>
 I will share with u the highlights of my first coding experience and some worthly insight i learnt along the journey.
</p>
<p>I vivdly remember the day i decided to dive into the world of coding.
 <mark> with my laptop and my jotter,</mark> I took my first step by installing python necessary software and setting up the coding environment.
  It was quite easy which made me determined to dive in and learn.
</p>
<p>Like other beginners and newbies to coding i stated with the classic <i><b>"Hello, World!"</b></i> program.
 Seeing those words appear on the screen was a small victory that fueled my excitement to learn even more.
</p>
<p>I began learning the <b>fundamentals of python</b>, <em>including variables, data types, loops.</em>
     The syntax seemed so <strong>foreign and abstract</strong> at first but with time they made sense.
      Each concept was like a building block to a big picture, helping me understand how code works.
 </p>
<p>One thing i have learnt along this journey is that you can solve python challenges or coding problems in general from different perspectives and methods,
  and still arrive at the same output.
     It is quite fascinating and mind blowing unlike how we were taught to approach problems in schools.
</p>
<p>Coding isn't always smooth sailing, the way we have watched it in movies.
   But with the <ins>patience</ins>, <ins>perservance,</ins> and the support of my tutor, online resources and communities.
   <del>I will be able to overcome the obstacles.</del>
</p>
<p>My first coding experiecnce with python was a rollercoaster of emotions from excitement and frustration to growth,
   although an incredible journey. I discovered the joy of<del> problem-solving</del>,
   <del>the satisfaction of creating something from scratch</del>, and the endless <del>possibities</del>del that coding offers.
